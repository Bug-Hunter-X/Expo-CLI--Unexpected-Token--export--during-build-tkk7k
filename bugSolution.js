The solution involves ensuring that the project's module resolution is configured correctly for ES modules.  This can often be achieved by verifying the babel configuration or ensuring that the import/export statements are compatible with the Metro bundler's current setup.  Alternatively, you might need to update the Expo version or apply specific transforms to support ES modules within the Metro bundler.
