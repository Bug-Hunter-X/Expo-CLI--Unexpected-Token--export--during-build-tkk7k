This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when building Expo projects: the 'Unexpected token export' error from the Metro bundler. This occurs when ES modules are used in a project with a different module system configuration.  The bug.js file shows the erroneous code, while bugSolution.js offers the corrected version.  This is a helpful guide to understanding and resolving this issue.
